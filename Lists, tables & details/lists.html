        Guys, now at 13:29 of 27-04-2024 we'll talk about definition list, it includes: 
        <dl>, <dt>, and <dd> tags; they are elements used together to create a definition 
        list in HTML.
        - <dl> (Definition List): This element is used to define the entire list of terms 
                                  and their corresponding descriptions.
        - <dt> (Definition Term): It marks the term being defined or described in the list.

        - <dd> (Definition Description): It marks the description or definition of the term defined by the 

        Example: <dl>
                    <dt>Coffee</dt>
                    <dd>Black hot drink</dd>

                    <dt>Milk</dt>
                    <dd>White cold drink</dd>
                 </dl> 
        
        - Definition e Usage of <dd> tag:
            The <dd> tag is used to describe a term/name in a description list.

            The <dd> tag is used in conjunction with <dl> (defines a description list) and <dt> (defines terms/names).

            Inside a <dd> tag you can put paragraphs, line breaks, images, links, lists, etc.

        - Possible scenarios:
            The example above uses the most simple way to use the defition list. Basically you have 
            term (dt) and next you have just one descrption of that term (dd). However you can have
            just a term but a several description, like this:
                <dl>
                    <dt>Coffee</dt>
                    <dd>Black hot drink</dd>
                    <dd>Caffeine font</dd>
                    <dd>Most cosumed drink in the world after water</dd>
                 </dl> 

            Also, you can have many terms but just one description:
                <dl>
                    <dt>Coffee</dt>
                    <dd>Tea</dd>
                    <dd>Juice</dd>
                    <dd>Beverages commonly consumed during breakfast.</dd>
                </dl>
