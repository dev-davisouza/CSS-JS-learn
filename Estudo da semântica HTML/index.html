    <!--
        If you're developing your front-end project you have to know that the semantic elements 
        in HTML are important for several reasons, as it helps improve the structure, accessibility, 
        and maintainability of your web pages. Here are some key reasons why you should use semantic 
        elements in HTML:

        1. Improved Accessibility:
            Semantic elements provide meaning to the content they enclose, making it easier for 
            assistive technologies (such as screen readers) to interpret and convey the information to 
            users with disabilities. This ensures a better user experience for all visitors, including 
            those who rely on assistive technologies.

        2. Better SEO:
            Search engines use semantic HTML to understand the structure and context of your content. 
            By using semantic elements, you can provide more accurate information about the content on 
            your page, which can positively impact your search engine rankings.

        3. Code Readability and Maintenance:
            Semantic HTML helps to create a clearer and more readable code structure. When you use 
            elements like <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, and <footer>, it becomes easier for 
            developers (including yourself and others who may work on the project) to understand the 
            purpose of different sections of your code. This, in turn, makes maintenance and updates 
            more straightforward.

        4. Consistency and Standardization:
            Semantic elements contribute to a standardized and consistent structure across different 
            web pages. This makes it easier for developers to collaborate and for tools and frameworks 
            to work more efficiently with your code.

        5. Enhanced Styling and Presentation:
            CSS and JavaScript frameworks often utilize semantic HTML to apply styling and behavior. 
            Semantic elements provide hooks for styling specific sections of your content, making it 
            easier to create visually appealing and responsive designs.

        6. Future-Proofing:
            Semantic HTML is designed to describe the meaning of content rather than just its 
            presentation. This approach makes your content more resilient to changes and updates, 
            ensuring that it remains relevant and functional as web technologies evolve.

        Here are some examples of semantic HTML elements and their purposes:

            <header>: Represents a group of introductory or navigational aids.
            <nav>: Represents a navigation menu.
            <main>: Represents the main content of the document.
            <article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and 
                       reused independently.
            <section>: Represents a generic section of content.
            <aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it.
            <footer>: Represents a footer for a section or a page.

        By incorporating these semantic elements appropriately, you contribute to a more accessible, 
        readable, and maintainable web presence.
