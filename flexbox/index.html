        <!--
            As you can see in this container it items receive an equal space (like margin) only between the 
            items, it means that this value consider the space just between the children of the container 
            (parent). So, it not consider the space between the margin of the container.

    <p>Flex-box (Default config) content justified with <i>space-around</i></p>

        <p>2</p>
        <p>3</p>
        <!--
            As you can see in this container it items receive an equal space (like margin). But here, unlike
            your brother above, the space-between, consider the margin of his parent, and aplly evenly spaces 
            between the elements and respecting his parent. However, here's an important observation: the spaces 
            generated by the space-around value not works like a margin property that overwrite the margin - if 
            you have a margin-bottom of 16px on one element and an element below with a margin-top of 16px, you 
            will not have a sum of distances between them that will result in 32px. Instead, the larger of the 
            two margins – in this case, 16px – will be used as the spacing between the two elements. This is 
            known as 'collapsing margins' in CSS, where adjacent vertical margins of block-level elements 
            collapse to the size of the larger margin, rather than being added together. So here, the proposal 
            is more simple; the algorithm just sums the spaces.

    <p>Flex-box (Default config) content justified with <i>space-evenly</i></p>
    <div class="flexbox flex-basic content-justified-space-evenly">
        <p>1</p>
        <p>2</p>
        <p>3</p>
        <!--
            So, before we had two problems - the first problem was that the spacing between the items didn't 
            respected his parent. The second problem was that despite the spacing respected his parent, it adds
            exaggerated spacing within the container. However, now we have 'the perfect spacing' in my opinion.
