        The <table> tag in HTML is used to create a table, which is a grid of 
        rows and columns used to display data in a structured format. Here's how it works:
        
        1. Table Structure: The <table> element defines the entire table. 
            Inside the <table> element, you can have multiple other elements:

            2. Table Row: Each row in the table is represented by the <tr> element. 
                Inside a <tr>, you define the cells of the row.

                    3. Table Header Cell: A header cell in a table is represented 
                        by the <th> element. It is typically used to represent column or row headers. 
                        Inside a <th>, you specify the header content.
                    4. Table Data Cell: A data cell in a table is represented by the <td> element. 
                        It contains the actual data to be displayed in the table. Inside a <td>, 
                        you specify the cell content.

    Like this below: 
    -->
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Column 1 Header</th>
            <th>Column 2 Header</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
            <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
            <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <!--
        The <table> tag is little bit confuse, bu very useful. 
            '<tr>' means: table row,
            '<th>' means table header and 
            '<td>' means table data.
        Also, you can make that a <td> fill more than one cell, in other words, 
        tou can make that a <td> occupy the space in more than one column with
        the attr named 'colspan', like this:
    -->
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Column 1 Header</th>
            <th>Column 2 Header</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2">Row 1, Column 1</td>
    </table>

    <!--
        WIthout a border style you can't see it, you just know that this <td>
        fills 2 cells.
        Also, you can make that a <td> occupy two rows with the attr rowspan:
    -->
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Column 1 Header</th>
            <th>Column 2 Header</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">Row 2, Column 1</td>
            <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">Row 2, Column 2</td>
            <td>Row 2, Column 3?</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <!--
        Moreover, tables has semantic as well as the all HTML by adding a division between 
        head and body, in the table context it works like this:
    -->
    <table class="course-table">
        <caption>Course price list</caption>
        <!--
            The <caption> element in HTML is used to provide a title or a brief explanation for a table. 
            It is typically placed immediately after the opening <table> tag and before any <thead>, 
            <tbody>, <tfoot>, or <tr> elements within the table. Here's why it's used:

                1.Table Description: The <caption> element allows you to provide a clear and concise 
                    description of the content or purpose of the table. This helps users, especially 
                    those using screen readers or other assistive technologies, understand the context 
                    and significance of the table.

                2.Accessibility: Including a <caption> element improves accessibility by providing 
                    additional information about the table's content. Screen reader users, for example, 
                    can benefit from having a descriptive caption read aloud to them, enhancing their 
                    understanding of the table.

                3.Semantic Structure: By using the <caption> element, you are structuring your HTML 
                    document in a semantically meaningful way. It separates the title or description 
                    of the table from the actual table data, making the document easier to understand 
                    for both humans and machines.

            <tr>
                <th>Occupation Area</th>
                <th>Course</th>
                <th>Investment</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>

            <tr>
                <td rowspan="3">Design</td>
                <td>InDesign</td>

            </tr>
