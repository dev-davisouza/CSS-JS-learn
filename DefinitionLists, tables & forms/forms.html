        Hey guys, it's me again. Today is cold (29-04-2024 at 10:32). 
        Lets talk about forms semantic :D
        
        The <form> tag in HTML is used to create an interactive form for collecting user input. 
        It's one of the fundamental elements for creating web forms, which are crucial for 
        gathering information from users, such as login details, feedback, or survey responses. 
        Here's an explanation of its semantics and usage:

            Semantic Meaning: The <form> element represents a section of a document that contains 
                interactive controls to submit data to a web server. It semantically groups together 
                related form controls and labels, providing a structure that helps browsers and 
                assistive technologies understand the purpose of the content.

            Attributes: The <form> element can have various attributes that control its behavior and appearance. Common attributes include:
                action: Specifies the URL where the form data should be submitted.
                method: Defines the HTTP method (e.g., GET or POST) used to submit the form data.
                enctype: Specifies how form data should be encoded before sending it to the server (e.g., application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data).
                target: Specifies where to display the response received after submitting the form (e.g., _self, _blank, or a named iframe).

            Form Controls: Inside the <form> element, you can include various form controls, such as 
                text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, select menus, and buttons. These controls 
                allow users to input data or make selections, which can then be submitted as part of 
                the form.

            Labeling: Each form control should ideally be associated with a <label> element using the 
                for attribute. This association improves accessibility and usability by providing a 
                clear label for each input field, making it easier for users to understand what 
                information is expected.

            Submission: When the user submits the form (e.g., by clicking a submit button), the browser 
                collects the values entered into the form controls and sends them to the URL specified 
                in the action attribute using the HTTP method specified in the method attribute.

            Validation: HTML5 introduced built-in form validation features, allowing you to specify 
                validation rules for form controls using attributes like required, pattern, min, and 
                max. Additionally, JavaScript can be used for more complex validation logic.

        Also, is very interesting the usage of the semantic inside the forms through <fieldsets> and
        <legend> tags:

            <form action="/submit-form" method="post">
                <fieldset>
                    <legend>login</legend>
                    <label for="username">Username:</label>
                    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
                    
                    <label for="password">Password:</label>
                    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
                </fieldset>
                <button type="submit">Submit</button>
            </form>
        
        Visually you can use h1, h2... to replace the <legend>, but for reasons of organization 
        and semantics is not recommended, but at the same time is not wrong. Similarly, it's not 
        wrong to not use the fieldsets, but for a better understanding of both the browser and 
        the developer it's very recommended for better maintenance and readability. Normally we
        learn to use forms just like this:

            <form action="/submit-form" method="post">
                <label for="username">Username:</label>
                <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
                
                <label for="password">Password:</label>
                <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
                <button type="submit">Submit</button>
            </form>

        Again, this is not wrong, but the usage of semantic is professionally acceptable.
