        Hey guys, it's me again. Today is cold (29-04-2024 at 10:32). 
        Lets talk about forms semantic :D
        
        The <form> tag in HTML is used to create an interactive form for collecting user input. 
        It's one of the fundamental elements for creating web forms, which are crucial for 
        gathering information from users, such as login details, feedback, or survey responses. 
        Here's an explanation of its semantics and usage:

            Semantic Meaning: The <form> element represents a section of a document that contains 
                interactive controls to submit data to a web server. It semantically groups together 
                related form controls and labels, providing a structure that helps browsers and 
                assistive technologies understand the purpose of the content.

            Attributes: The <form> element can have various attributes that control its behavior and 
            appearance. Common attributes include:

                action: Specifies the URL where the form data should be submitted.
                method: Defines the HTTP method (e.g., GET or POST) used to submit the form data.
                enctype: Specifies how form data should be encoded before sending it to the server 
                    (e.g., application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data).
                target: Specifies where to display the response received after submitting the form 
                    (e.g., _self, _blank, or a named iframe).

            Form Controls: Inside the <form> element, you can include various form controls, such as 
                text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, select menus, and buttons. These controls 
                allow users to input data or make selections, which can then be submitted as part of 
                the form.

            Labeling: Each form control should ideally be associated with a <label> element using the 
                for attribute. This association improves accessibility and usability by providing a 
                clear label for each input field, making it easier for users to understand what 
                information is expected.

            Submission: When the user submits the form (e.g., by clicking a submit button), the browser 
                collects the values entered into the form controls and sends them to the URL specified 
                in the action attribute using the HTTP method specified in the method attribute.

            Validation: HTML5 introduced built-in form validation features, allowing you to specify 
                validation rules for form controls using attributes like required, pattern, min, and 
                max. Additionally, JavaScript can be used for more complex validation logic.

        Also, is very interesting the usage of the semantic inside the forms through <fieldsets> and
        <legend> tags:

            <form action="/submit-form" method="post">
                <fieldset>
                    <legend>login</legend>
                    <label for="username">Username:</label>
                    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
                    
                    <label for="password">Password:</label>
                    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
                </fieldset>
                <button type="submit">Submit</button>
            </form>
        
        Visually you can use h1, h2... to replace the <legend>, but for reasons of organization 
        and semantics is not recommended, but at the same time is not wrong. Similarly, it's not 
        wrong to not use the fieldsets, but for a better understanding of both the browser and 
        the developer it's very recommended for better maintenance and readability. Normally we
        learn to use forms just like this:

            <form action="/submit-form" method="post">
                <label for="username">Username:</label>
                <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
                
                <label for="password">Password:</label>
                <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
                <button type="submit">Submit</button>
            </form>

        Again, this is not wrong, but the usage of semantic is professionally acceptable.

            <legend>Common Login form</legend>

        The password input type in HTML is used to create a text field where users can enter passwords. 
        Unlike regular text inputs, the characters entered in a password input are masked or hidden to 
        protect the security of the password being entered. Here are some key points about the password 
        input type:

            1. Masked Input: When a user types into a password input field, the characters are 
                typically displayed as asterisks (*) or dots (â€¢) instead of the actual characters. 
                This helps prevent shoulder surfing, where someone nearby may see the password being 
                typed.

            2. Security: The primary purpose of the password input type is to securely collect sensitive 
                information, such as passwords, without revealing them to others. This helps protect user 
                accounts and sensitive data from unauthorized access.

            3. Form Submission: When a form containing a password input field is submitted, the value 
                entered into the password field is sent to the server just like any other form data. 
                However, it's important to note that the value is typically encrypted or hashed on the 
                server side for added security.

            4. Autocomplete: Browsers often offer autocomplete functionality for password input fields, 
                allowing users to save and autofill their passwords for convenience. However, this 
                feature should be used with caution, especially on shared or public devices, to avoid 
                unauthorized access to user accounts.

            5. Attributes: The password input type supports standard HTML attributes such as required, 
                maxlength, and pattern, which can be used to specify validation rules or constraints for 
                password input fields.
    -->
    <form action="/submit-form" method="post">
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Password type</legend>
            <label for="password">Password:</label>
            <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
        </fieldset>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

    <!--
        Checkboxes are a type of input control in HTML used to allow users to select one or more 
        options from a list of choices. They are typically represented as small boxes that can be 
        checked or unchecked by the user. Here are some key points about checkboxes:

            1. Selection: Checkboxes allow users to select multiple options from a list by checking or 
                unchecking the checkboxes associated with each option. Unlike radio buttons, checkboxes 
                are not mutually exclusive, meaning users can select multiple options simultaneously.

            2. HTML Element: In HTML, checkboxes are created using the <input> element with the 
                type="checkbox" attribute. Each checkbox is associated with a specific value using the 
                value attribute, which is sent to the server when the form containing the checkbox is 
                submitted.

            3. Labeling: To provide context and clarity to users, checkboxes are often accompanied by 
                labels using the <label> element. The for attribute of the <label> element is set to 
                the id of the associated checkbox, allowing users to click on the label to toggle the 
                checkbox.

            4. Checked State: Checkboxes can have an initial checked state by adding the checked 
                attribute to the <input> element. This means that the checkbox will be selected by 
                default when the page loads, unless the user manually unchecks it.

            5. Form Submission: When a form containing checkboxes is submitted, the values of all 
                checked checkboxes are sent to the server as part of the form data. On the server side, 
                the values can be processed and used to perform actions or make decisions based on the 
                user's selections.

            6. Styling: Checkboxes can be styled using CSS to match the design of the webpage. 
                However, styling checkboxes can be challenging due to limited customization options 
                across different browsers.

        Here's an example of how to create checkboxes in HTML:
    -->
    <form>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Checkbox type</legend>
            <input type="checkbox" id="option1" name="option1" value="Option 1">
            <label for="option1">Option 1</label><br>
            
            <input type="checkbox" id="option2" name="option2" value="Option 2" checked>
            <label for="option2">Option 2 (checked by default)</label><br>
            
            <input type="checkbox" id="option3" name="option3" value="Option 3">
            <label for="option3">Option 3</label><br>
        </fieldset>
    </form>

    <!--
        Radio buttons are another type of input control in HTML used to allow users to select one 
        option from a list of choices. Unlike checkboxes, radio buttons are mutually exclusive, 
        meaning that only one option can be selected at a time. When one radio button is selected, 
        any previously selected radio button in the same group is automatically deselected. 
        Here are some key points about radio buttons:

            1. Selection: Radio buttons are used when users need to select exactly one option from a 
                list of two or more mutually exclusive options. Once a radio button is selected, it 
                cannot be unchecked directly; instead, selecting another radio button in the same group 
                automatically deselects the previously selected one.

            2. HTML Element: In HTML, radio buttons are created using the <input> element with the 
                type="radio" attribute. Each radio button is associated with a specific value using 
                the value attribute, which is sent to the server when the form containing the radio 
                buttons is submitted.

            3. Grouping: Radio buttons are grouped together using the name attribute, which specifies 
                the name of the radio button group. Radio buttons with the same name attribute belong 
                to the same group, and only one radio button within the group can be selected at a time.

            4. Labeling: Similar to checkboxes, radio buttons are often accompanied by labels using the 
                <label> element. The for attribute of the <label> element is set to the id of the 
                associated radio button, allowing users to click on the label to select the radio button.

            5. Form Submission: When a form containing radio buttons is submitted, the value of the 
                selected radio button within the group is sent to the server as part of the form data. 
                On the server side, the value can be processed and used to perform actions or make 
                decisions based on the user's selection.

            6. Styling: Radio buttons can be styled using CSS to match the design of the webpage. 
                However, styling radio buttons can be challenging due to limited customization options 
                across different browsers.

        In this example above, three radio buttons are created, each with an associated label. 
        All radio buttons belong to the same group (name="options"), and only one can be selected 
        at a time. The second radio button is initially selected by default (checked attribute). 
        When the form is submitted, the value of the selected radio button is sent to the server.
    -->
    <form>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Radio type</legend>
            <input type="radio" id="option1" name="options" value="Option 1">
            <label for="option1">Option 1</label><br>
            
            <input type="radio" id="option2" name="options" value="Option 2" checked>
            <label for="option2">Option 2 (selected by default)</label><br>
            
            <input type="radio" id="option3" name="options" value="Option 3">
            <label for="option3">Option 3</label><br>
        </fieldset>
    </form>
    
    <!--
        The file input type (<input type="file">) is an HTML element used to create a file upload 
        control in web forms. It allows users to select one or more files from their device's 
        filesystem and submit them to a web server for processing. Here are some key points about 
        the file input type: 

            1. Appearance: The file input element typically appears as a button or a text field with 
                a "Browse" button next to it, depending on the browser and operating system. When 
                clicked, it opens a file picker dialog where users can select files from their 
                local storage.

            2. Accept Attribute: The accept attribute can be added to specify the types of files that 
                the input accepts. This can be a file extension (e.g., .jpg, .pdf) or a MIME type 
                (e.g., image/*, application/pdf). However, it's important to note that the accept 
                attribute is only a hint to the browser and does not prevent users from selecting 
                files of other types.

            3. Multiple Files: By adding the multiple attribute (<input type="file" multiple>), 
                you can allow users to select multiple files at once. This creates a multi-file 
                selection interface where users can choose multiple files using their operating 
                system's file picker.

            4. Form Submission: When the user selects one or more files and submits the form containing 
                the file input, the selected files are included in the form data. The file data is 
                typically sent as part of a multipart/form-data request to the server, along with any 
                other form fields.

            5. JavaScript Access: File input elements can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript. 
                You can use JavaScript to listen for file selection events, validate file types and 
                sizes, and perform other actions based on user interaction with the file input.

        Here's a basic example of how to use the file input type in an HTML form:
    -->
    <form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <fieldset>
            <legend>File type</legend>
            <label for="fileInput">Select a file:</label>
            <input type="file" multiple id="fileInput" name="file">
        </fieldset>
        <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
